    "## Particle Filter-based Visual Object Tracking (Shape Matching Game)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a visual tracking algorithm (using a particle filter) combined with an interactive shape matching game. The game uses a moving red object (held by the user and detected via background substraction, HSV filtering and morphological operations - pixel-level operations) to control a ball (in the form of a triangle, square, rectangle, or circle) whose position is tracked by a particle filter. In the game, the ball (displayed as a filled shape) must match the target shape (displayed as an outline) to score points, while avoiding obstacles.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction to the Real-World Problem\n",
    "Accurate object tracking is a fundamental challenge in various real-world applications, including surveillance systems, traffic monitoring, and virtual reality (VR) in the gaming industry. The ability to reliably track a moving object, despite challenges such as noise, occlusions, and lighting variations, is essential for ensuring the effectiveness of these applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project simulates an interactive scenario in which a user controls a virtual ball using hand movements. The system utilizes a particle filter to track the ball’s position, allowing it to navigate and interact with different elements within a dynamic environment, such as targets, obstacles, and power-ups. While this scenario is designed as a game, the underlying object tracking techniques are directly applicable to practical problems, making the project a valuable learning tool for real-world tracking applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Potential Real-World Applications\n",
    "Beyond its use in gaming, this system has significant potential in other domains, including healthcare rehabilitation and education:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rehabilitation & Physical Therapy: The tracking mechanism used in this project could be applied in rehabilitation programs, where medical professionals monitor a patient’s hand, finger, or arm movements after an injury or neurological disorder (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury). Introducing this system in the form of a game (Gamification) can serve as a motivational tool for patients, encouraging them to perform repetitive movements necessary for recovery.\n",
    "- Education & Learning: The interactive nature of the game makes it well-suited for educational applications, particularly for young children learning shapes and spatial awareness. By matching different shapes through hand movements, children can develop cognitive and motor skills in an engaging and immersive way.\n"

    "## 2. Detection and Tracking Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In our game, the ball's position is tracked using a [Particle Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter), a probabilistic approach well-suited for visual tracking in uncertain or noisy environments. This algorithm is particularly effective in scenarios where traditional deterministic tracking methods struggle, such as when dealing with occlusions, lighting variations, and sensor noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Detection Algorithm - Obtaining Measurement:\n",
    "In our implementation, the measurement is obtained by detecting a moving red object within each video frame by combining background subtraction, color segmentation, and morphological opeartions on detected contours. This method isolates dynamic red regions while filtering out static red elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1.1. Background Subtraction:\n",
    "In this step, we apply a background subtractor (`cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2`) to each input frame to generate a `foreground mask`. This mask highlights moving objects, helping to ignore static regions in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1.2. Color Conversion and Red Masking:\n",
    "  We convert RGB color space to HSV and use the two color ranges to capture the complete spectrum of red color:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\begin{align*}\n",
    "  \\text{Range 1: } & [0, 120, 70] \\quad \\text{to} \\quad [10, 255, 255] \\\\\\\\\n",
    "  \\text{Range 2: } & [170, 120, 70] \\quad \\text{to} \\quad [180, 255, 255]\n",
    "  \\end{align*}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1.3. Masking:\n",
    "- **Mask Combination:**  \n",
    "  Two masks are created—one for each red range—and then combined to cover all possible red color ranges. The red mask is compared to the foreground mask using a bitwise AND operation to find the region of interest (ROI). We do this to ensure that only the moving red regions are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mask Cleaning:**  \n",
    "  The combined mask is refined using:\n",
    "  - **Erosion:** Removes small noise.\n",
    "  - **Dilation:** Restores the eroded parts.\n",
    "  - **Gaussian Blur:** Smooths the mask to further reduce artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1.4. Contour Detection:\n",
    "- **Contour Extraction:**  \n",
    "  We extract the largest contour of the mask from the previous step and use that as the contour of the moving red object\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Centroid Calculation:**  \n",
    "  The centroid of the largest contour is computed using image moments:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  c_x = \\frac{M_{10}}{M_{00}}, \\quad c_y = \\frac{M_{01}}{M_{00}}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1.5. Tip Detection Using Convex Hull:\n",
    "- **Convex Hull:**  \n",
    "  A convex hull is generated around the selected contour to encapsulate its shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Farthest Point Determination:**  \n",
    "  The algorithm then identifies the point on the hull that is farthest from the centroid. This point is assumed to be the tip of the red object.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1.6. Output:\n",
    "- **Measurement Point:**  \n",
    "  If a valid red object is detected, the coordinates of the farthest point (i.e., the tip) are returned as the measurement. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Summarizing the above steps, the detection algorithm consists of:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract Foreground:** Apply background subtraction to isolate moving objects.\n",
    "2. **Segment Red Regions:** Convert the frame to HSV, define red color ranges, and create a combined red mask.\n",
    "3. **Refine Mask:** Clean the mask using erosion, dilation, and Gaussian blur.\n",
    "4. **Detect Contours:** Identify contours and select the largest one \n",
    "5. **Compute Centroid:** Calculate the centroid of the selected contour.\n",
    "6. **Identify Tip:** Use the convex hull to find the point farthest from the centroid.\n",
    "7. **Return Measurement:** Output the tip’s coordinates as the detected red object’s position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Tracking Algorithm: Why Use a Particle Filter?\n",
    "A particle filter models the object's state (in this case, the ball’s position and velocity) as a set of particles, each representing a possible location of the object. By continuously predicting and updating these particles based on motion dynamics and sensor observations, the algorithm can effectively estimate the object's true position.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 How It Works in Our Implementation\n",
    "<b>Prediction (Motion Model)</b>: Each particle represents a possible state (position, velocity) of the ball.\n",
    "Particles are propagated according to estimated motion dynamics, with some random noise added to account for uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Update (Correction with red object Tracking Data)</b>: When a measurement is available (e.g., the detected red object position processed via background subtraction, HSV filtering and morphological operations), the algorithm compares the predicted particle positions with the observed measurement.\n",
    "Particles closer to the measurement receive higher weights, while those farther away receive lower weights.\n",
    "A resampling process is then applied, selecting particles proportionally to their weights, ensuring the most likely positions of the ball are retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.4 Advantages of Using a Particle Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to use a particle filter over other well-known filters, such as the Kalman filter, is driven by several key advantages. The particle filter is particularly well-suited for our application because it can effectively model non-linear and non-Gaussian systems. Additionally, it offers the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Robustness to Noisy Measurements</b>: This is especially valuable when tracking objects detected through pixel operations, which can introduce fluctuations and inaccuracies.\n",
    "- <b>Resilience to Occlusion</b>: Unlike traditional methods, the particle filter algorithm can estimate the ball's location even when it is temporarily occluded.\n",
    "- <b>Adaptability to Varying Lighting Conditions</b>: Since the tracking relies on a probabilistic model rather than strict visual cues, it can dynamically adjust to different environments."

    "#### 4.2 The Ball Class\n",
    "The Ball class represents a game object that is tracked using a particle filter. It is responsible for initializing the ball’s position, maintaining a set of particles representing possible states (position and velocity), estimating their states based on motion dynamics (including abrupt movements), and rendering the ball within a visual frame. The class integrates probabilistic tracking and adaptive resampling to ensure accurate position estimation even during rapid movements or temporary occlusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Key Functionalities include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization (__init__ method)**\n",
    "    - Initializes the canvas size, ball parameters, and shape selection (randomly chosen from predefined shapes such as circle, square, rectangle, or triangle).\n",
    "    - Calls `_init_position()` to ensure the ball starts fully within the canvas boundaries.\n",
    "    - Calls `_init_particles()` to generate an initial distribution of particles around the ball’s position, with each particle represented by a 4D state vector \\([x, y, v_x, v_y]\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ball Position Initialization (_init_position)**\n",
    "    - Determines a random starting position based on the ball's shape and dimensions.\n",
    "    - Ensures the ball does not exceed the canvas boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Particle Initialization (_init_particles)**\n",
    "    - Creates a set of particles, each represented as a 4D state \\([x, y, v_x, v_y]\\).\n",
    "    - Initializes the particles’ positions around the initial ball position using a normal distribution.\n",
    "    - Assigns each particle a small random velocity, allowing the filter to model the ball's dynamics.\n",
    "    - These particles serve as hypotheses for the ball’s state (both position and velocity) in subsequent frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Particle Filter Update (update method)**\n",
    "    - **Prediction Step:**\n",
    "        - Estimates each particle’s position using its current velocity, with additional motion noise.\n",
    "        - Estimates each particle’s velocity by adding acceleration noise to account for potential abrupt movements.\n",
    "    - **Correction Step (if a measurement is available):**\n",
    "        - Reweights particles based on the proximity of their positions to the observed measurement (i.e., a moving red object is detected) using a Gaussian likelihood.\n",
    "        - Computes the effective sample size (a measure of particle degeneracy).\n",
    "        - **Adaptive Resampling:** Resamples particles based on their weights only if the effective sample size falls below a set threshold, thereby maintaining particle diversity while favoring particles closer to the measurement.\n",
    "    - Ensures the particles remain within the canvas boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Position Estimation (get_position method)**\n",
    "    - Computes the mean of the \\([x, y]\\) positions of all particles to estimate the most probable ball location.\n",
    "    - Returns a smoothed position that reduces the influence of outlier particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Rendering the Ball (draw method)**\n",
    "    - Uses OpenCV drawing functions to render the ball based on its shape.\n",
    "    - Visualizes the particles (for debugging or demonstration purposes), displaying their current positions.\n",
    "    - Supports rendering for various geometric shapes (circle, square, rectangle, triangle).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a few words, this class works as follows:\n",
    "- **Initialization:** A set of particles (with positions and velocities) is created around the initial ball position.\n",
    "- **Prediction:** Each particle’s state is estimated using its position, velocity and random noise, simulating realistic motion dynamics.\n",
    "- **Update (Correction):** If a measurement (moving red object detected) is available:\n",
    "    - Particles are weighted based on their proximity to the measurement.\n",
    "    - Adaptive resampling is performed if the effective sample size is low, favoring particles closer to the measured position while preserving diversity.\n",
    "- **Position Estimation:** The mean of the particles’ positions is computed and returned as the ball’s estimated location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is shown in the cell below!\n"

    "1. Initialization (__init__ method)\n",
    "    - Assigns the shape, canvas size, and target parameters (size properties for each shape).\n",
    "    - The position is initially set to None and is later assigned externally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Margin Calculation (get_margin method - Static)\n",
    "    - Determines the required margin around the target based on its shape.\n",
    "    - This ensures the target does not exceed the canvas boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "    - Circles require a radius margin.\n",
    "    - Squares require a half-side margin.\n",
    "    - Rectangles use the largest dimension divided by two.\n",
    "    - Triangles require a side-length margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Target Creation (create_targets method - Static)\n",
    "    - Randomly assigns four targets (one in each corner of the canvas) using different shapes.\n",
    "    - Ensures that each target has a unique shape by shuffling the shape list.\n",
    "    - Determines the position of each target while maintaining proper spacing from the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Drawing the Target (draw method)\n",
    "    - Uses OpenCV to render the target as an outlined shape (not filled).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The function:\n",
    "    - Draws a circle, square, rectangle, or triangle at the assigned position.\n",
    "    - Uses polylines for triangles and rectangles/circles for other shapes.\n",
    "    - Sets the outline thickness to differentiate targets from the ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Checking if the Ball is Inside the Target (point_inside method)\n",
    "    - Determines if a given point (ball position) is within the target's boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The logic differs for each shape:\n",
    "    - Circle: Checks if the ball’s center is within the target radius.\n",
    "    - Square/Rectangle: Ensures the ball’s center falls within the bounding box.\n",
    "    - Triangle: Uses OpenCV's point-in-polygon test to verify containment.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How the Target Class Integrates with the Game\n",
    "- Each game round places four targets at different corners.\n",
    "- The player must navigate the ball to the correct target based on its shape.\n",
    "- If the ball enters a matching target, the player scores points.\n",

    "### 4.7 Game Class (Main Controller)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Game** class serves as the main controller for the game. It manages the overall game flow, processes player input, updates game objects, detects collisions, handles scoring, renders visuals, and manages game-over conditions. This implementation integrates object tracking (via red object detection), physics (using a particle filter), and various game mechanics (targets, obstacles, power-ups) along with immersive feedback (sound and visual effects).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.7.1. Initialization (`__init__` method)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audio System Setup:**\n",
    "  - Loads and initializes sound effects for scoring, penalties, level-ups, power-ups, and combo bonuses using `pygame.mixer`.\n",
    "  - Implements error handling in case audio files (e.g., `score.wav`, `penalty.mp3`, `levelup.mp3`, `Powerup.wav`, `combo.wav`) are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game Configuration:**\n",
    "  - Defines the canvas size as **720x1280** (height x width) for display.\n",
    "  - Sets parameters such as the number of particles (e.g., 300) for the particle filter and the motion noise level for simulating realistic movement.\n",
    "  - Specifies properties for the ball and targets, including the supported shape types (circle, square, triangle, rectangle) and their corresponding dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game State Variables:**\n",
    "  - **Score:** Tracks the points earned by the player.\n",
    "  - **Hearts (Lives):** The player starts with **15 hearts**.\n",
    "  - **Level:** Game difficulty scales as the score increases (level-up every 5 points).\n",
    "  - **Combo Mechanics:** Tracks consecutive successful target hits to apply a combo multiplier (with bonus sounds every three hits).\n",
    "  - **Shield Status:** Indicates whether the player currently has an active shield power-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object Initialization:**\n",
    "  - **Ball:** Implements a particle filter to track its position based on input measurements from red object detection.\n",
    "  - **Targets:** Creates target zones (with outlines) at designated corners, each having a unique shape.\n",
    "  - **Obstacles:** Initializes moving obstacles that bounce off the screen edges and increase in speed as the level rises.\n",
    "  - **Power-ups:** Randomly spawns power-ups that grant a temporary shield when collected.\n",
    "  - **Particle Effects:** Generates visual effects for feedback on scoring and collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Red Object Detection Setup:**\n",
    "  - Uses OpenCV’s `VideoCapture` to access the webcam and flips the frame for intuitive control.\n",
    "  - Applies a background subtractor along with HSV color thresholding to detect a moving red object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.7.2 (Red object detection)\n",
    "This method responsible for the handling of the detection of the red object held by the user. Within this method, we process each frame by first applying the background model to obtain a foreground mask. We then convert the frame to the HSV color space in order to define the color range for the object of interest; in this case, a red moving object. We then combine the red mask to the foreground mask in order to filter out only red moving objects. This is necessary because other moving objects could be detected in the foreground mask as well. Following this, we apply morphological operations such as erosion and dilation and the apply a Gaussian filter to filter out noise. For the resulting mask, we apply contour detection to find contours of red moving objects and the largest contour is assumed to be the region of interest. We then apply Convex Hull to find the farthest point which in this case is assumed to be the tip of the red object held by the user. \n",
    "Once this measurement is obtained, we pass the measurement to the update method of the ball which then proceeds with the prediction and update steps of the particle filter. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.7.3. Main Game Loop (`run` method)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `run` method drives the continuous game loop with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Frame Processing & Input Handling:**\n",
    "  - Captures frames from the webcam and flips them horizontally.\n",
    "  - Processes each frame to detect the moving red object. The detection is performed using a combination of background subtraction and HSV filtering, and the detected red object’s tip serves as the measurement input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ball Tracking Update:**\n",
    "  - The ball’s particle filter updates its state using the measurement from the red object detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Obstacle Movement Update:**\n",
    "  - Obstacles update their positions each frame and bounce off the boundaries of the canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shield Timer Update:**\n",
    "  - If a shield is active (from collecting a power-up), its duration counts down until it expires.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collision & Scoring Checks:**\n",
    "  - **Power-up Collection:**\n",
    "    - If the ball collides with a power-up, a shield is activated (with associated sound and particle effects), and the power-up is removed from play.\n",
    "  - **Obstacle Collisions:**\n",
    "    - A collision between the ball and any obstacle causes the player to lose a heart (unless shielded), resets the combo counter, and triggers a red explosion effect along with a penalty sound.\n",
    "  - **Target Zone Check:**\n",
    "    - When the ball enters a target zone:\n",
    "      - **Correct Shape:** Increases the score (with a combo multiplier) and triggers a green particle effect along with a scoring sound. A bonus combo sound is played every three consecutive hits.\n",
    "      - **Wrong Shape:** Causes the loss of a heart (unless shielded) and triggers a red effect with a penalty sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game Difficulty Scaling:**\n",
    "  - The game levels up every 5 points. Leveling up increases the speed of the obstacles, making the game progressively more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object Reset After Events:**\n",
    "  - After any collision or scoring event, the game resets key objects:\n",
    "    - A new ball is generated.\n",
    "    - Targets and obstacles are re-randomized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Particle Effects Update:**\n",
    "  - Animates particle effects to provide visual feedback on impacts and scoring events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rendering:**\n",
    "  - All game elements (ball, targets, obstacles, power-ups) and UI overlays (score, hearts, level, combo multiplier, shield status) are drawn on the frame using OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game Over Handling:**\n",
    "  - If the player’s hearts drop to 0, a \"GAME OVER\" message is displayed before ending the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exit Conditions:**\n",
    "  - The game exits either when the player presses the 'Q' key or when the game-over condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.7.4. Cleanup and Resource Management\n",
    "\n",
    "After exiting the main game loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The webcam capture is released with `cap.release()`.\n",
    "- All OpenCV windows are closed using `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`.\n",
    "- Pygame’s mixer is shut down with `pygame.mixer.quit()` to free audio resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the Game Class Contributes to Gameplay\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrated Game Mechanics:** Combines obstacle avoidance, target matching, power-ups, and scoring to create a dynamic and engaging experience.\n",
    "- **Interactive Control:** Utilizes red object detection to enable intuitive, gesture-based control of the ball.\n",
    "- **Progressive Difficulty:** The game scales in challenge as the score increases by speeding up obstacles.\n",
    "- **Immersive Feedback:** Enhances gameplay through synchronized sound effects and visual particle effects that react to in-game events.\n",

    "## 6. Challenges and Possible Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Challenges Faced:\n",
    "- **Occlusion:** In real-world tracking scenarios, the target red object can be partially or fully occluded by other objects or the user's hand. Although our particle filter smooths out some noise, handling severe occlusions remains a challenge and may require more advanced tracking methods.\n",
    "- **Lighting Conditions:** Variations in ambient lighting can adversely affect the performance of red object detection and video processing. Inconsistent lighting may lead to false detections or missed measurements, making robust pre-processing (e.g., adaptive histogram equalization) essential.\n",
    "- **Predicting Non-Linearity of Object Motion:** The movement of the red object may be non-linear—sudden stops, abrupt direction changes, or erratic motions can occur. This unpredictability makes it challenging for the particle filter to accurately predict the next state based solely on previous frames. Hence, in the absence of measurement, the movement of the ball is purely random (although the program works quite well even in the event of measurement missing in a few couple of frames!)\n",
    "- **Real-Time Performance:** Handling real-time video capture, processing particle updates, collision detection, and rendering all within a single loop can be demanding, especially on less powerful hardware. Optimizing performance without sacrificing accuracy is a key challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Lessons learned:\n",
    "- We learned that the particle filter is indeed very good in capturing non-linearity in motion and hence, well-suited dealing with non-linear dynamic systems\n",
    "- The background subtraction can be tricky if the background has movements (most especially if they have same colors as the object of interest)\n",
    "- While traditional vision techniques such as the one employed in our implementation are fast, it becomes tedious to account for dynamic changes such as lighting conditions or occlusions; although the particle filter is great at handling these to some extent.\n",
    "- We also came to the realization that traditional computer vision techniques are not suitable if multi-class detection and tracking is desired.\n",
    "- In our experience, resampling the particles is a crucial step in enabling the particle filter to excel.\n",
    "- Hand movements are not linear, and so any sudden stop or pause can hurdle the state estimation severely (particles will then turn to make random moves - as there is no measurement available in that case) although temporal stop or pauses does not seem to have any substatial negative effect on the algorithm. \n",
    "- The process of selecting the best parameters through experimentation and intuition can be a great pain (and we felt it 🙂)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible Improvements:\n",
    "- **Enhanced Detection Parameters:** Instead of relying solely on a fixed HSV threshold, incorporating dynamic thresholding or multi-color detection could improve the robustness of the red object detection under varying lighting conditions.\n",
    "- **Robust Object Tracking Methods:** Employing more advanced tracking techniques—such as deep learning–based object detectors or integrating optical flow—could mitigate issues related to occlusion and rapid motion.\n",
    "- **Adaptive Particle Filtering:** Adjusting the number of particles dynamically based on the effective sample size or the complexity of the motion could improve the state estimation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.\n",
    "- **Alternative State Estimation Algorithms:** While the particle filter works well for noisy measurements, exploring other state estimation methods (e.g., Unscented Kalman Filter) may offer improved performance in predicting complex, non-linear motions\n",
    "- **Improved Collision Detection:** Fine-tuning the collision detection logic for obstacles and targets possibly by using more precise shape representations. This could reduce false collisions and improve game responsiveness.\n",
    "- **User Interface Enhancements:** Enhancing the user interface with features such as a start menu, detailed instructions, real-time feedback for scoring and level-ups, or even visual indicators of the tracking accuracy could make the game more engaging and accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making these improvements would not only make the game more engaging and reliable but also enhance the applicability of our tracking algorithm in more complex, real-world scenarios. Thank you!\n",
